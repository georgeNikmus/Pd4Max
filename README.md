Pd4Max library contains some of the most important Pure Data objects for signal processing and
enables the precise realization of the patches/examples from M.Puckette's "Theory and Techniques 
of Electronic Music" (https://github.com/georgeNikmus/The-Theory-and-Technique-of-Electronic-Music-Max-Patches), 
and A.Farnell's "Designing Sound" (https://github.com/georgeNikmus/Designing-Sound-Max-Patches) in the Max/MSP environment.
Using this library any Pure data project should be precisely portable with some minor modifications.
The binaries only work for Windows systems,but I have included the source code if you wish to compile them for MacOS.
Welcome for corrections and other contributions if you are interested.

Note: pdquad~ object refers to the biquad~ PD object. I changed the name to avoid conflicts.
In Max/MSP biquad~ already exists but is slighlty different than the biquad~ for PD
