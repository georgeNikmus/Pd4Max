Pd4Max library contains some of the most important Pure Data objects for signal processing and
enables the precise realization of the patches/examples from M.Puckette's "Theory and Techniques 
of Electronic Music", and A.Farnell's "Designing Sound" in the Max/MSP environment.
Using this library any Pure data project should be precisely portable with some minor modifications.
The binaries only work for Windows systems,but I have included the source code if you wish to compile them for MacOS.
Welcome for corrections and other contributions if you are interested.
